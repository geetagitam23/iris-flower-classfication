Here's what the output means:

The accuracy is 1.0, which indicates that the Decision Tree classifier correctly classified all the samples in the test dataset.

The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (0, 1, and 2), as well as macro and weighted averages. Since the accuracy is 1.0, you'll see that all precision, recall, and F1-score values are 1.00 for each class, indicating perfect classification.

Keep in mind that due to random splitting of the data, the exact numbers in the output may vary, but you should expect high accuracy and F1-scores since the Iris dataset is relatively easy to classify.
